Hi Rob,

Thank you so much for your book. It it very educative. I was trying to understand more about trading rules correlations in "Chapter 8: Combined Forecasts". You mentioned that back-testing the performance of trading rules to get correlation.

Could you share a bit more insights on how you get the performance of trading rules, please?
(1) Do you set buy/sell threshold at +/- 10? meaning that no position held when signal is [-10,10], only 1 position held when signal is [10,20] and [-20,-10] and 2 positions held when signal is at -20/+20?
(2) Trading cost is considered? (I think the answer is yes.)
(3) You entry a buy trade, say at signal=10. When do you signal to exit the trade? when signal<10 or signal=0?

or you use dynamic positions, meaning the position varies with signal all the time.

Another question regarding optimisation:
In the formula: f*w - lemada*w*sigma*w' to estimate weights
(1) f is rules' sharpe ratio calculated using the rules' historical performance pooled from all instruments or just the sharpe of the rule from the instrument we look at?
(2) how do you define lemada? =0.0001? if so, is it always 0.0001?

Sorry if those two questions had been asked before.

Thanks,
Deano

To get the performance of a trading rule you run through the position sizing method in the book allocating 100% to a given trading rule.

1) No, that isn't how the system works at all. Read the rest of the book before asking any more questions.
2) yes - again this in discussed later in the book
3) No, I use continous positions. You need to read chapter 7 again as you don't seem to have quite got the gist.

f*w - lemada*w*sigma*w

I don't think I've ever used this formula in my book, or on my blog, so I can't really explain it.
